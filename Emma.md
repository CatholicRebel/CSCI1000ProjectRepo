Hi!
My name is Emma McArthur
I am currently a freshmen at CU Boulder studying CS
I’m interested in learning C++ and becoming more fimilar with other programming languages such as Java and Python
During my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, dog, friends, skiing, playing tennis, playing video games, and hiking.
I’m looking to learn from others on different languages and getting started
